## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Adaptive Traffic Light System repository. This project aims to address the chronic problem of traffic congestion in Sri Lanka's urban areas by developing an intelligent traffic management system. Our solution leverages real-time weather and traffic data to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, optimizing traffic flow and reducing the need for manual intervention by traffic police.

## Problem Definition

Sri Lanka faces significant traffic congestion issues, causing delays, increased fuel consumption, and necessitating the deployment of traffic police at busy intersections. The traditional pre-programmed traffic light systems are inadequate for adapting to real-time traffic and weather conditions, leading to inefficiencies and extended travel times. Our project aims to mitigate these issues through a smart, adaptive traffic light system.

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of the SLIoT competition, and we are continuously working towards achieving our goal of revolutionizing traffic management in Sri Lanka. The SLIoT competition provided us with a platform to innovate and create a solution that addresses real-world problems with cutting-edge technology.

## Proposed Solution

### Components

1. **IoT Sensors**: Monitor traffic flow, detect vehicles, and assess environmental conditions.
2. **Centralized Control System**: Features a sophisticated traffic control algorithm for real-time analysis and adaptation.
3. **Smart Traffic Lights**: Dynamically adjust based on real-time data from the control system.
4. **Mobile App**: Provides real-time traffic updates, alternative route suggestions, and allows users to report incidents and give feedback.

### Unique Features

- Real-Time Adaptability
- IoT Integration and Connectivity
- Predictive Traffic Analysis with AI
- Citizen Empowerment through a Mobile App
