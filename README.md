# Nextify-Adaptive-Traffic-Control-System
This project uses a camera module to capture traffic and transmit frames to a central computer via WiFi. A machine learning model detects vehicles, providing a vehicle count every minute, and dynamically adjusts traffic light waiting times at a 3-way junction. This ensures efficient traffic flow and reduces congestion.
